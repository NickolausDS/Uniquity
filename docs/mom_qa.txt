moms first use of Uniquity:

When user first opened Uniquity, they were confused about which buttons to push.
	1st attempt: They drag and dropped files onto Uniquity
	2nd attempt: They pressed the 'play' button, without adding files via the add files button
	user then quit and asked for help

When showed how to add files to Uniquity:
	user added the WHOLE system to Uniquity, having it scan EVERYTHING including system files.
	This process would have taken a long time to complete had she actually let that run

When files were scanned:
	User scanned application specific folder, the entire mac "pictures" folder managed by iPhoto
		User attempted to delete pictures which may have caused iPhoto to function improperly
