##Uniquity -- The Unique File Analyzer

This is where all of the development for Uniquity will take place. It is not expected to be expanded until there is a full release of Uniquity. However, you're welcome to check out the code, or leave a bug report on the issues page if you find anything.

Docs are not currently available because of the rapidity of change within the project. Tutorials will be created once the project is at a beta release, and even more documentation will be written on a major version release (1.0.0). You can see the changelog for the latest changes since the last version.

Check out the [main website](http://windwardproductions.org/projects/Uniquity/) if you are interested in using the latest stable build!
