Version .1 -- The Command Line Interface

The first version of Uniquity has been released!

The purpose of this version was to establish Uniquity as a tool, focusing on usability rather than aesthetics. This version will include as follows:

	* Scan flies, and find duplicates based on content!
	* Supply whole directories of files to scan
	* Limit directory scans based on depth
	* Display duplicate files in a simple list for use in scripting programs
	* Display duplicate files in a pretty list for user display
	* Run in quiet mode, and suppress non-critical output (for use in scripting programs)
	* Run in verbose mode, giving the user all possible data
